# 5V to 3.3V Voltage Regulator (Altium Project)

This is a beginner-level Altium Designer project that converts 5V input to a stable 3.3V output using a MIC5317 voltage regulator. It includes basic schematic design and PCB layout, making it perfect for learning how to use Altium and understanding voltage regulation in embedded systems.

## Project Overview

- **Input Voltage**: 5V  
- **Output Voltage**: 3.3V  
- **Regulator Used**: MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR  
- **Capacitors**: 2 × 1µF  
- **Connectors**: 2 × JST SM02B-GHS-TB (LF)(SN)
