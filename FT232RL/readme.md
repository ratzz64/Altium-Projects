# FT232RL USB-to-Serial Converter Circuit

This repository contains the schematic, PCB layout, and documentation for a USB-to-Serial converter circuit based on the **FTDI FT232RL** chip. This circuit provides a reliable interface between USB ports and UART-based microcontrollers or other TTL serial devices.

## üì¶ Features

- USB to UART (TTL level) interface
- Baud rates from 300 bps to 3 Mbps
- 3.3V or 5V logic level operation
- Integrated EEPROM for USB descriptors
- Optional modem control signals (RTS, CTS, DTR, DSR)
- LED indicators for TX and RX
- Standard 6-pin UART header (compatible with Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, etc.)
