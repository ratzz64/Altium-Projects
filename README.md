# 💡 Altium Project

## 🧾 Overview  
This project is a beginner-level design created using **Altium Designer**. As I am still learning the software, this project represents my first steps in PCB design and serves as an introduction to Altium's capabilities. The goal of the project is to practice basic concepts such as schematic creation, PCB layout, and generating necessary outputs for fabrication.

## 📁 Project Structure  
-  **Schematic** – Contains the schematic design of the project.  
-  **PCB Layout** – Contains the PCB layout design files.  
-  **Libraries** – Custom components or parts used in the design.  
-  **Outputs** – Gerber files, BOM (Bill of Materials), and other fabrication files.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

1.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
2.  Open the project in Altium Designer by double-clicking the `.PrjPCB` file.  
3.  Explore the schematic and PCB layout files.  

## 🛠️ Requirements  
-  [Altium Designer version you used for the project]  
-  Components/libraries used in the project (include any third-party libraries or custom components if applicable).  

## 🧪 How to Use  
1.  Open the schematic and PCB files in Altium Designer.  
2.  Modify the design as needed for your application.  
3.  Generate the Gerber files for fabrication using **File > Fabrication Outputs**.  
4.  Export the Bill of Materials (BOM) for purchasing components.
